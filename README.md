# R_EDA_TitanicSurvivalAnalysis

## 📘 Project Portfolio - Exploratory Data Analysis

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is a crucial step in data science, aimed at understanding the structure of data, identifying patterns, and communicating meaningful insights.  
This project uses the **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle — a classic case study widely used in both machine learning and analytics contexts.

---

## 📖 Project Description

This project was created as part of the final assignment in the **Digital Fair Skill bootcamp** — a 5-day mini course that introduces participants to the role of a Data Scientist.  
The Titanic dataset was chosen for its balanced challenge, covering tasks such as **data cleaning**, **exploratory analysis**, and **insight generation through visualization**.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand the structure and features of the Titanic dataset.
- Handle data issues such as missing values and duplicates.
- Explore the relationship between **social titles** and passenger survival.
- Communicate insights clearly through effective **visualizations**.

---

## 🔍 Insight

One of the key highlights of this analysis is the **extraction and use of the `Title` feature** from each passenger’s name.  
This led to several interesting findings:

- Titles can reflect **social class, age range**, and **marital status** of passengers.
- Titles like **Miss** and **Mrs** had significantly **higher survival rates** compared to **Mr**.
- Although **Mr** was the most frequent title (appearing in hundreds of records), the survival rate was only around **21%**.
- In contrast, children and women had notably higher survival rates, reinforcing the assumption that evacuation prioritized them.

## 🧩 Dependencies

The following Python libraries were used in this project:

- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

To run this notebook, make sure the dependencies above are installed.

## 💡 Advice

If this dataset were used for predictive modeling (e.g., survival prediction), the `Title` feature could serve as a powerful engineered variable.  
It not only reduces dimensionality from complex names but also introduces social context into the model.  

Future EDA improvements may include:
- Comparing survival rates by **class, age, fare**, and **embarkation point**.
- Exploring interactions between multiple variables.
- Building simple predictive models based on the cleaned dataset.
